## Exercise 3:

- At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code? What exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?
  line 55 of boot.S, where `ljmp $PROT_MOD_CSEG, $protcseg`
- What is the last instruction of the boot loader executed, and what is the first instruction of the kernel it just loaded?
  call ....
  Last instruction of the boot loader executed:
  `0x7d6b:      call   DWORD PTR ds:0x10018`
  First instruction of the kernel it just loaded:
  `0x7d6b:      call   DWORD PTR ds:0x10018`

- Where is the first instruction of the kernel?
  entry.Sï¼š44
- How does the boot loader decide how many sectors it must read in order to fetch the entire kernel from disk? Where does it find this information?
  The `fileoffset` and `size` offset in elf header for seach segment.

## Exercise 7:

Before setting up the page, 0x00100000 is the kernel code where as 0xf0100000 is empty. After executing the code and the paging is exampled, 
both 0x00100000 and 0xf0100000 are mapped to kernel execution code.

Since the relocate is a mapping to 0xf010002f, it failed to load if paging is not enabled.
